They contain information related to the web browser and the specific website, and are saved in a designated folder on your hard drive. When you revisit a website, the cookie can be used to recognize the visitor and provide a personalized browsing experience based on their history. Web beacons are typically small, transparent graphic images that are placed on websites and used to monitor user behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies are used to improve the user experience by enhancing visitor friendliness. By using cookies to identify visitors, users do not have to repeatedly enter the same information, such as login credentials or screen settings, each time they visit a website.</span></p><h4><span style="font-weight: 400;">Which kind of cookies exist?</span></h4><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Often, a distinction is made between two large groups of cookies:</span></p><p><strong>First-party cookies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These cookies are created by the website you are visiting to enhance its performance.

First-party cookies are generated and placed by the visited website.</span></p><p><strong>Third-party cookies</strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">: These cookies are created and placed on your device by a third-party other than the website you are visiting. They track a user's browsing behavior and are commonly used by social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter, as well as by tools like Google Analytics to measure website traffic.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Cookies that are necessary for the proper functioning of the site do not require permission.
